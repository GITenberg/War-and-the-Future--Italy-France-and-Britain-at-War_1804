description: "War and the Future (1917) is a work of war propaganda by H.G. Wells\
  \ that was published in the North America under the title Italy, France, and Britain\
  \ at War (the subtitle of the British original). Wells would have preferred the\
  \ title The War of Ideas, but his publisher over-ruled him. Except for the opening\
  \ piece, its chapters were published as articles in the press. Though proclaiming\
  \ early in the volume that \"I avow myself an extreme Pacifist,\" Wells staunchly\
  \ supported Britain's war against Germany \"in the hope that so we and the world\
  \ may be freed from the German will-to-power and all its humiliating and disgusting\
  \ consequences henceforth for ever.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
